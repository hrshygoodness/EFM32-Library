====== Kit Examples ======

This package include examples for the EFM32GG_DK3550 Gecko development kit
from Energy Micro.

====== Dependencies ======

This package _requires_ the EM_BSP_COMMON and EFM32 CMSIS packages to be
installed at the same level as this package. If you did not get this as part
of the Simplicity Studio application, you should also download and install the
EFM32 CMSIS package. See the Changes file for required version.

The CMSIS package requires C99 support, and so does this package.

====== File structure ======

kits/EFM32G_DK3550/config
   Configuration data for BSP and Drivers in EM_BSP_COMMON.

kits/EFM32G_DK3550/examples
   Several example projects demonstrating various capabilities of the
   EFM32G890F128 and the kit specific functionality.
   Project files for various IDEs/compilers are in subdirectories of
   each example. Use these as a starting point for your own development
   and prototyping of EFM32 Gecko software.
